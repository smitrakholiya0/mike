Used to retrieve domain registration details (registrar, owner, creation/expiry dates, contact info).

Example: whois google.com


2. ping

Tests network connectivity between your machine and a host.

Measures round-trip time (RTT) and packet loss.

Example: ping amazon.in -c 10


3. nslookup

Queries DNS servers to get domain/IP mapping.

6. traceroute / tracert

Shows the path packets take from your system to a destination.

Displays intermediate routers (hops).

Example: tracert google.com


7. netstat

Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics.

Useful options:

-at → Active TCP connections

-u → UDP connections

-s → Statistics


8. tcpdump
