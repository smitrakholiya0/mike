Write a Selenium WebDriver test script in Java to perform the following tasks:
Write a Selenium WebDriver test script in Java that automates the product
search process on the Flipkart website. The script should begin by launching the
Edge browser and opening the URL https://www.flipkart.com/. Once the page
is loaded, ensure that the browser window is maximized. Your script should then
locate the search box using a suitable locator strategy, enter the keyword
“tablet”, and perform the search operation so that the results are displayed.
After executing the search, include a validation step to check whether the results
page is correctly displayed. Based on this validation define whether the test case
has passed or failed. Finally close the browser after 5000ms.

Question-2
Prepare a Test Case Report in Excel to verify the “product search functionality”
on https://www.flipkart.com/. The report should be well-structured and clearly
formatted. It should include unique test case IDs, detailed descriptions, the
sequence of steps to be followed, and the expected outcomes. While preparing
the report, think about different scenarios such as searching with valid product
names, entering invalid or blank inputs, and other possible variations that a user
might attempt. Record the actual results after executing the cases and mark the
status accordingly as Pass or Fail. Prepare at least 10 test cases that cover a mix
of positive and negative scenarios using a proper Excel template.

Question-3
Write a TestRigor test case to automate the product search process on the
Flipkart website. The test should open the Flipkart homepage in a browser,
maximize the window, locate the search box, enter the keyword “Tablet”, and
submit the search query. Display the results page, include a validation step using
TestRigor’s check command. Finally, close the browser.
